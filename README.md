# VideoToPhasedAudioTransform

This transforms a mp4 or mov file into a phased audio wav file.  It's largely useless but fun and goes with the other project on my github repos page.  (SoundPhaseVisualizer)

You'll need to have the QT5 multimedia widgets and plugins installed to make this project work.

It's all GPL, and should be free forever.  Enjoy.

This is a fun project inspired by Lostboy.net's Ryan Clarke.  He did something that I hadn't seen before.  So I needed to figure out a way to do it, too.  Thanks Ryan!

Hope you like it,
-Mark.
